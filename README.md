DWINDLING OF CARBON-DIOXIDE USING COOLING WIND TOWER

ABSTRACT

The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has been identified as a major contributor to global warming and climate change. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and one such strategy is the use of cooling wind towers with clay pots filled with KOH solution. This technology involves designing structures that can be used in gardening areas and hotels to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

The cooling wind towers consist of a tall structure with an opening at the top that allows air to enter. The structure is designed to create a flow of air that passes through the clay pots filled with KOH solution and also we use NaOH solution.For the better results of this, we get the NaOH generates less heat when compared to KOH.Also the inclusion of Zeolite, the absorption of Co2 is less and we are getting better results with the inclusion of Zeolite. The KOH solution absorbs CO2 from the air, and converts into KHCO3 as a byproduct and also reduces the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. we use sensors to detect surrounding co2 and temperature. 

The design of these structures can be adapted to fit the architecture of gardens and hotels, making them both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The use of cooling wind towers with clay pots filled with KOH solution could be a viable solution to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, while also providing a sustainable way to cool indoor and outdoor spaces.This system reduces the temperature naturally up to 10°C to 12 °C. 

Further research and development are necessary to optimize the design and effectiveness of this technology, but it holds promise as a simple and effective solution to mitigate the effects of climate change.
